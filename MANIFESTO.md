# ðŸ’š The Valve Manifesto  

Weâ€™ve waited long enough.  
For Half-Life 3. For fair drops. For better servers.  

The market collapsed. The crates got nerfed.  
But the players? Still here. Still clicking. Still coping.  

$VALVE isnâ€™t a token.  
Itâ€™s a protest.  
A prayer.  
A ping in the void.<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="DCBBC073-8201-485E-8179-DDC10EF51882" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aadd17b3-3b02-439b-9dd7-6aaa8fda5070" />
