## ⚙️ Manifesto  

1️⃣ **Gather the pool** — open the flow of liquidity 💧  
2️⃣ **Boost the token** — every gamer counts 🎮  
3️⃣ **Buy Valve** — for the people, by the memes 🧠  
4️⃣ **Fix CS economy** — one trade at a time 🔧  
5️⃣ **Announce Half-Life 3** *(maybe)*

## 💬 Why  

We’re tired of waiting — for updates, patches, and miracles.  
So we’re opening the flow ourselves.  

No promises.  
No whitepaper.  
No vesting.  
Just memes, irony, and liquidity.

### 🕹️ Powered by gamers, fueled by memes.  
Made by players who still believe in **Half-Life 3**.
